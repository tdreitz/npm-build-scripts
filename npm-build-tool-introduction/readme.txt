For this course I will use Node 4.0 that you can install from (http://nodejs.org). And Npm of version v2.14.2, that will be installed together with Node. 

I’m recording this on a OsX but everything that I show will be able to run on Linux / Windows as well. There’s a few places where there are minor differences and I will point those out as we go.
